# Combinational_Circuits-DLD
The implementation of different kinds of combinational circuits such as half adder,full adder,seven segment display,2 to 4 line decoder,Multiplexer,demultiplexer,BCD Encoder, BCD Decoder, parity checkers etc.


The following shows the sequence of aim of experiments: -
1.
AIM: Design a combinational circuit with three inputs x,y and z and three outputs A,B nd C
using full adders and an inverter. When the binary input is 0,1,2 or 3 the binary output is
one greater than the input. When the binary input is 4,5,6 or 7 the binary output is one less
than the input.
2.
AIM: implement the four Boolean functions listed using three half adders
3.
AIM: design 2-bit parallel adder/subtractor circuit.
4.
AIM: design a BCD adder using binary parallel adder. 
5.
AIM: design a circuit to convert 2421 to 84-2-1. 
6.
AIM: Design a circuit to compare two 4 bit numbers using IC 7485.
7.
AIM: To design BCD to seven segment display
8.
AIM: Design a circuit to display thrice of a number on seven segment display (consider maximum
input number to be 2 bit)
9.
AIM: To design a 2 to 4 line decoder.
10.
AIM: Design a logic circuit to control the traffic light as per the given details. Using
the sensor outputs A,B,C and D as inputs, N-S and E-W be two outputs that go high. 
11.
AIM: Design a decimal to BCD encoder
12.
AIM: To design a 8 to 3 line priority encoder
13.
